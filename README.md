### Introduction ###
An online Towers of hanoi solver. The user selects the number of blocks between 5-10, once the number has been selected, clicking start solves the puzzle.

### Project Objectives ###
The main purpose of this project is to improve my web development skills with HTML, CSS and mostly JS. Secondary objective is to create a well made TOH solver for people.

### Site User Roles ###
Since this is only a front-end project there is just the guest user of the site.

### Design Specifications ###
The design of the game is quite simple and can be seen in the above picture. That is roughly how it should look like, tho through iterations it may change. 

### Success criteria ###
Little bugs, functional site both on web and mobile.

### Project Timeline ###
Step one will be writing the HTML, styling, colouring, positioning, writing the logic, testing and debugging. Hopefully to finish by the end of March.
